	//If it is method overriding means, we are dealing with inheritance concept
	//If subclass(child class) has the same method as declared in the parent class is called method overriding
	//Other name for method overriding is run time polymorphism
	//Rules for method overriding
	//A. Method must have same name as in the parent class
	//B. Method must have same parameter as in the parent class
	//C. Must be IS-A relationship (inheritance)
	//Uses for method overriding
	//A. It is used to provide a specific implementation of a method that is already provided by its super class(parent class)
	
	//Parent class is called as super class
	//Child class is called as sub class
	

	//This method overriding includes the HDFC and RBI program

	//RBI is a parent class
	//HDFC is a child class
